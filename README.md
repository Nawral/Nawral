3. Install Overwolf & Voicemeeter
4. Restart
5. Set your default audio device to Voicemeeter input
6. Set your default audio output to Voicemeeter output
7. If you still need audio output, open Voicemeeter, in the Audio Output setting choose the output that goes to your Headphones/Speakers
8. If you communicate with your microphone, make sure the programs using it have the input device manually set to your microphone, not to default device
9. Download the latest version of Narwal
https://github.com/Nawral/Nawral/releases (don't use the links on the top of this page, that's for the source code!)
10. Open the Overwolf browser, navigate to overwolf://packages/
11. Click Install Extension
12. Browse to where the extension was downloaded and select it.
13. Launch Narwal. The overlay will open automatically on game launch, or you can manually open it.
